- INTRODUCTION -

This design kit provides support for the design of RRAM structures with 180nm CMOS process.
Use the Metal 6 layer to contact the TE and BE electrode of each memory cell.
The connection with the underlying metal layer (ME5) is possible only using vias (VI5) placed under the ME6 electrodes. 
A Design Rules Manual and a standard RRAM cell are provided to show the correct design approach.
Before starting to use the DK, you have to go through the following INSTALLATION section. 


 - INSTALLATION -

RRAM_CMOS_DK installation has been tested on Cadence Virtuoso 6.1.6-64b.
The installation procedure can slightly change if you are using other versions of Cadence.
It is recommended to start with a clean installation of the 180nm design kit.
Perform "chmod 755 ./* -R" in the design kit folder to adjust the permissions on all the files.

1. Merge the Technology Files:
- open the RRAM technology file (RRAM_CMOS_DK/RRAM.tf); at the line:
include( "/path/to/main_tech_file" )
replace "/path/to/main_tech_file" with the absolute path of your 180nm technology file.

2. Merge the Display Resource Files:
- open the RRAM drf file (RRAM_CMOS_DK/RRAM.drf); at the line:
load( "/path/to/main_drf_file" )
replace "/path/to/main_drf_file" with the absolute path of your 180nm drf file;
- copy the edited RRAM.drf to the Cadence run directory and rename it to "display.drf";
- in case you already started Cadence Virtuoso, you can go in Tools -> Display Resource Manager -> Edit; select File -> Reinitialize and confirm; in this way you are going to reload the drf.

3. Import RRAM_CMOS_Lib in Cadence:
- in the main window of Cadence Virtuoso, go to Tools -> Library Path Editor;
- go to Edit -> Add Library; select the RRAM_CMOS_Lib (RRAM_CMOS_DK/RRAM_CMOS_Lib) and confirm;
- coming back to the "Library Path Editor" window, go to File -> Save;
This procedure is adding the RRAM library to your Library Manager.

4. Load the edited tech file in Cadence:
- in the main window of Cadence Virtuoso, go to Tools -> Technology File Manager -> Load;
- select the edited tech file at point 1 (RRAM_CMOS_DK/RRAM.tf) in the "ASCII Technology File" field;
- select the technology library RRAM_CMOS_Lib (RRAM_CMOS_DK/RRAM_CMOS_Lib) in the "Technology Library" field;
- make sure the options "Select all" and "Replace" are selected;
- click "OK" and confirm.

5. Merge the Layer Map files:
- append the content of the layermap file of your 180nm design kit to the RRAM_CMOS_DK layermap file (RRAM_CMOS_DK/RRAM_CMOS_Lib/RRAM_CMOS_Lib.layermap);
you can do this by hand or using a simple bash command as: cat layermap2 >> layermap1. In this way, you are going to append layermap2 to layermap1;
The layermap file is usually placed in your 180nm library and has extensions like ".layermap" or ".map".

6. Merge the Calibre DRC rules:
- open the RRAM DRC file (RRAM_CMOS_DK/Rulefiles/Calibre/DRC/RRAM_drc.cal); at the line:
INCLUDE /path/to/main_drc_file
replace "/path/to/main_drc_file" with the absolute path of your 180nm DRC file;
- now the Calbre DRC routine is going to check the layout constaints on both CMOS and RRAM elements when you load the RRAM DRC rules (RRAM_drc.cal).

7. Merge the Calibre LVS rules:
- open the RRAM LVS file (RRAM_CMOS_DK/Rulefiles/Calibre/LVS/RRAM_lvs.cal); at the line:
INCLUDE /path/to/main_lvs_file 
replace "/path/to/main_lvs_file" with the absolute path of your 180nm LVS file;
- now the Calbre LVS routine is going to check the layout vs schematic corrispondence on both CMOS and RRAM elements when you load the RRAM LVS rules (RRAM_lvs.cal).

8. Restart Cadence to make all the changes effective.


 - USE -

Only after the installation procedure, cells can be correctly designed using the RRAM_CMOS_Lib.
It is possible to attach design libraries to it.
You can perform the DRC and LVS check on your design loading the correct RRAM Calibre rules.
